h2. Validating Signed OpenSocial Requests - HMAC-SHA1

This sample code is intended to showcase how to validate OpenSocial HMAC-SHA1 signed requests.  This validation is an alternate method of "Validating Signed Request":http://wiki.opensocial.org/index.php?title=Validating_Signed_Requests via public certs.  This sample code includes the following files:
* signed_requests.xml - The OpenSocial gadget that initiates the signed request
* signed_requests_validate.php - The server-side validation script

h3. Library Dependancies

This sample code requires the OAuth PHP library located "here":http://github.com/yahoo/yos-social-php5/blob/master/lib/OAuth/OAuth.php.  This file needs to be copied to the same folder as the files located in this project.

h3. Setting Up This Example

To set up this example, there are several steps that need to be taken:
* In signed_requests.xml change the "url" parameter to the absolute URL to the signed_requests_validate.php file
* In signed_requests_validate.php add in your consumer key ($key variable) and consumer secret ($secret variable)
